# PyFontoBene
FontoBene parser using Python

Hello!! every one

this is the first my own project on github.

in the first time using github for me.

I want to join with the original FontoBene project as below.

But I am beginner in github. I don't know how to using and join that project.

So I decide to make my own this project first.
