![alt text](https://github.com/metaperson/PyFontoBene/blob/master/ScreenShot/FontoBene%20Drawing%20Test.png)


this is the first my own project on github.

in the first time using github for me.

I want to join with the original FontoBene project as below.

But I am beginner in github. I don't know how to using and join that project.

So I decide to make my own this project first.



# simple 2 steps needed to drawing text.

1. load font file.

  font = PyFontoBeneFont.createFromFile("newstroke.bene")

2. draw font to tkinter canvas

  font.drawText(font_canvas, x=50, y=30, ratio_x=2, ratio_y=2, text="Hello World!!!")
